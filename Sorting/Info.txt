What is Sorting?
Ans: Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(eg. an array) so that the
     items are in some kind of order.
For example:
        Sorting numbers from smallest to largest.
        Sorting names alphabetically.
        Sorting movies based on release date.
        etc.

Javascript has built in sort methods

Example: Array.sort()

["a","d","b","c"].sort() => ["a","b","c","d"]

The built in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
you can use this comparator function to tell Javascript how you want it to sort.
The comparator looks at pairs of elements(a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value.
  if it returns -ve number, a should come before b
  if it returns +ve number, b should come before a
  if it returns 0, then a and b are equal

  [1,4,5,2,3].sort((a,b)=> a-b) => [1,2,3,4,5]



  Time complexities

  Algo            Best     Worst    Space
  Bubble Sort      O(n)    O(n^2)   O(n^2)    O(1)
  Insertion Sort   O(n)    O(n^2)   O(n^2)    O(1)
  Selection Sort   O(n^2)  O(n^2)   O(n^2)    O(1)
