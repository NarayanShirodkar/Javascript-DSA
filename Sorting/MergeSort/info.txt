* Its a combination of two things - merging and sorting
* Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
* Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements,
    then building up a newly sorted array.


Merging arrays

* In order to implement merge sort, it useful to first implement a function responsible for
 merging two sorted arrays.

* Given two arrays which are sorted, this helper fucntion should create a new array which is
 also sorted, and consists of all of the elements in the two input arrays.

* This function should run in O(n+m) time and O(n+m) space and should not modify the parameters
 passed to it.

Pseudocode

# Create a empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input array.
# while there are still values we haven't looked at....
        - If the value in first array is smaller than the value in the second array, push the value
         in the first into our results and move on to the next value in the first array.
        - If the value in the rist array is larger than the value in the second array, push the next
         value in the second array into our results and move on to the next value in the second array.
        -Once we exaust one array, push in all remaining values from the other array.      


****** Merge Sort Pseudocode ******

* Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element.
* Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back
 at the full length of the array.
* Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged(sorted) array.
